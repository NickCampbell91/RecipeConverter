# Overview

This was my first attempt at creating an app. I have always found the idea of creating my own applications facinating and was very excited to try.

The app is meant to convert the current serving size of a recipe to a desired serving size. This is not currently possible as the application is not finished.

My hope for this app was to create something I myself would find useful, because by using it myself I would come up with improvements as time went on.
